								<h2 class="major">Intro</h2>
								<p>Hi! I'm Connor Buckley. I'm a Junior studying Computer Science at the University of Southern California, scheduled to graduate in May 2020. I am currently working part time as a Data Analyst Intern for <a href="https://www.northridgegroup.com/" target="_blank">The Northridge Group</a>, a management consulting, quality monitoring, and customer experience firm. This is an extension of the internship position I held last summer with Northridge.</p>
								<p>Outside of tech, I enjoy Hiking, Cooking, and Gaming. I have a personal goal to finish the <a href="https://socalhiker.net/a-six-pack-of-peaks/#9/34.0504/-117.3477" target="_blank">So-Cal Six Pack of Peaks</a> before I graduate. To learn more about me, check out my <a href="cbuckleyResume.pdf" target="_blank">Resume</a> or my <a href="#about">About me</a> page.</p>

									<h2 class="major">Darker Notes</h2>
									Darker Notes is a note-taking application with the feature of parsing Markdown and LaTeX to create rich documents incorporating these tools. This enhances note-taking ability in otherwise difficult classes to take notes for such as mathematics and coding courses.
									<br>
									<br>
									This project has given me experience with Web Development in Java and JavaScript. I managed all database interaction through MySQL, connected front-end code to back-end code, and gained experience managing a large project across front-end and back-end teams.
									<br>
									<br>
									The GitHub repository for this project can be found <a href="https://github.com/Laurenzarus/DarkerNotes">here</a>.
